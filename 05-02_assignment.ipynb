The new class, called the subclass or derived class, inherits all the attributes and methods of the existing class, called the superclass or base class. The subclass can also add new attributes and methods or override existing ones. There are several types of inheritance, including single inheritance (where a subclass inherits from one superclass), multiple inheritance (where a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses), multilevel inheritance (where a subclass inherits from a superclass which itself inherits from another superclass), and hierarchical inheritance (where multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass)ยนโธ.\n"
